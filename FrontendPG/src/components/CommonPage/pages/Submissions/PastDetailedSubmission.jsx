            <div className="common-pg-sub-details"> Definition:
              Ring topology is a type of network configuration where devices are connected in a circular
              manner, forming a closed loop. In this setup, each device is connected to exactly two other
              devices, creating a continuous pathway for data transmission. This means that data travels in
              only one direction around the ring, passing through each device until it reaches its destination.
              ‚ùñ Characteristics:
              1. Circular Structure: In a ring topology, the network devices are arranged in a closed
              loop or circle.
              2. Unidirectional Data Flow: Data travels in only one direction around the ring, passing
              through each device until it reaches its destination.
              3. Token Passing: To avoid collisions, some ring networks use a method called token
              passing, where a special packet (token) is passed from one device to the next,
              granting the right to send data.
              4. Reliability: Ring topology can be relatively reliable because if one device or
              connection fails, it doesn't necessarily disrupt the entire network.
              5. Performance: In terms of performance, ring networks can be efficient for
              transmitting data, especially if token passing is used to manage access to the
              network{submission.summary}</div>
